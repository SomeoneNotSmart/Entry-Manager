# Encrypted SQL Entry Manager

A simple Python application that allows users to create, view, and delete encrypted entries using a GUI built with `Tkinter`. The entries are stored securely in an encrypted SQL file, ensuring that only the app can access and manipulate the data.

## Features
- **Add New Entries**: Easily add new text entries with a timestamp.
- **View Entries**: View all the encrypted entries in a readable format with timestamps.
- **Delete Entries**: Select and delete entries from the database through an intuitive interface.
- **Encrypted Storage**: Entries are securely stored in an encrypted SQL file, making the data unreadable without the app.
